# COMP 691 â€“ Online Algorithms and Competitive Analysis

## Compilation and Execution Information

## Code Documentation
The `Combined` class provides methods for generating a random page request sequence, creating a modified sequence,
 * adding noise to the modified sequence, and simulating a cache with a modified page eviction algorithm.

 * The main functionality includes:
  - Generating a random page request sequence using the `generateRandomSequence` method.
  - Creating a modified sequence based on the given input using the `generateH` method.
  - Adding noise to the modified sequence with the `addNoise` method.
  - Simulating a cache with a modified page eviction algorithm using the `blindOracle` method.

 * The class also contains helper methods:
  - `chooseRandomPage`: Helper method for randomly selecting a page from a set.
  - `findPageToRemove`: Helper method for finding a page to evict in case of a cache miss.

 * The main method demonstrates the usage of these functionalities with example parameters and prints the generated
 * sequences along with the number of page faults in the blind replacement simulation.
